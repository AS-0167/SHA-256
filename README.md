# 🔐 SHA-256 Hash CLI Tool

## 🚀 Overview

The **SHA-256 Hash CLI Tool** is a powerful command-line utility that allows users to compute the **SHA-256** hash of a file and store the result in a specified output file. This tool is lightweight, efficient, and ensures that large files exceeding system memory are not processed, preventing crashes. 

🛠 **Implemented from scratch in C without using any hashing library!**

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 Computes the **SHA-256** hash of a given file.
- 🚀 Prevents loading files larger than available system memory.
- 📝 Outputs the hash to a user-specified file.
- ⚡ Simple installation and usage via the command line.

## 📥 Installation

To install the tool, follow these steps:

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AS-0167/SHA-256.git
cd SHA-256
```

### **2️⃣ Build the Executable**

```sh
make
```

### **3️⃣ Install the CLI System-Wide**

```sh
sudo make install
```

This installs the tool as `sha-256-hash` in `/usr/local/bin`, making it accessible from anywhere in the terminal. ✅

---

## ⚙️ Usage

Once installed, you can run the tool using the following syntax:

```sh
sha-256-hash --fpath <file_path> --sha256path <output_path>
```

### **📌 Example**

To compute the SHA-256 hash of `example.txt` and save it to `hash_output.txt`, use:

```sh
sha-256-hash --fpath example.txt --sha256path hash_output.txt
```

### **⚠️ Error Handling**

- ❌ If the file does not exist, the program will display an error message.
- 🚨 If the file size exceeds system memory, the program will **terminate safely**.
- ⚙️ If incorrect flags are provided, a usage message will be shown.

## ❌ Uninstallation

To remove the tool from your system, run:

```sh
sudo make uninstall
```

This deletes the installed binary from `/usr/local/bin/sha-256-hash`. 🗑️

## 🛠 Development

If you wish to modify or contribute to this project, follow these steps:

### **1️⃣ Clean Previous Builds**

```sh
make clean
```

### **2️⃣ Delete the Executable**

### **3️⃣ Run Without Installing**

```sh
make run
```

This will execute the tool without installing it system-wide. 🚀
